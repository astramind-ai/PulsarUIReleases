# Pulsar UI Releases

Welcome to the Pulsar UI Releases page! We're excited to share our progress with you.

## About Pulsar

Pulsar is an open-source project aimed at making advanced AI accessible locally. Created by two enthusiastic programmers, our goal is to provide a powerful AI backend with an intuitive user interface, all running on your local machine.

## UI Releases

This repository contains the releases for the Pulsar User Interface. While our backend is open-source, we've made the decision to keep the UI closed-source for now. This allows us to iterate quickly and maintain a consistent user experience.

### Latest Release: v0.1.0

Our current release is v0.1.0. As an early version, it may have some rough edges, but we're actively working on improvements.

#### Download

2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Feedback and Contributions

While the UI itself is closed-source, we greatly value community input:

- For bug reports or feature requests related to the UI, please open an issue in this repository.
- For backend-related issues or contributions, please visit our [main repository](link-to-main-repo).

Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve Pulsar. We're just two programmers with a big vision, and every user's experience matters to us.

## Roadmap

We're continuously working to enhance Pulsar. Here's a glimpse of what we're planning:

- Improved model management interface
