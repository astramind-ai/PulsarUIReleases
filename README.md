# 🚀 Pulsar UI Releases

Welcome to the Pulsar UI Releases page! We're excited to share our progress in making advanced AI accessible locally.

## 🧠 About Pulsar

Pulsar is an open-source project aimed at democratizing AI technology. Created by two dedicated developers, our goal is to provide a powerful AI backend with an intuitive user interface, all running on your local machine.

## 🖥️ UI Releases

This repository hosts the releases for the Pulsar User Interface. While our backend is open-source, we've opted to keep the UI closed-source for now to ensure rapid iteration and a consistent user experience.

#### 🛠️ Installation

1. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

First install the backend via the installer, it will take care of both the UI and backend installation.
- 🪟 [Windows Installer](link-to-windows-installer)
- 🐧 [Linux AppImage](link-to-linux-appimage)

If you had already downloaded it you can just download the latest UI version and log in in to your account
2. Execute the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Launch Pulsar and establish a connection to your local Pulsar backend.
