# 🚀 Pulsar UI Releases

Welcome to the Pulsar UI Releases page! We're excited to share our progress in making advanced AI accessible locally.

## 🧠 About Pulsar

Pulsar is an open-source project aimed at democratizing AI technology. Created by two dedicated developers, our goal is to provide a powerful AI backend with an intuitive user interface, all running on your local machine.

## 🖥️ UI Releases

This repository hosts the releases for the Pulsar User Interface. While our backend is open-source, we've opted to keep the UI closed-source for now to ensure rapid iteration and a consistent user experience.
